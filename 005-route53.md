# Route 53

## What is DNS?
- DNS translates human-friendly hostnames into machine IP addresses.
- DNS uses a hierarchical naming structure.
- ".com" is a top-level domain.
- "example.com" is a domain.
- "www.example.com" is a subdomain.
- DNS records include: A, AAAA, CNAME, NS.

## Route 53
- Scalable, highly available managed authoritative DNS.
- Authoritative means the customer can update the DNS records.
- Route 53 also functions as a domain registrar.
- It's the only AWS service with a 100% availability SLA.
- The reference to "53" is from the traditional DNS port.

## Route 53 Records
- Determines how to route traffic for a domain.
- A record maps a hostname to an IPv4 address.
- AAAA record maps a hostname to an IPv6 address.
- CNAME record maps a hostname to another hostname.
- CNAME targets must have an A or AAAA record.
- A hostname uniquely identifies a device on a network.
- Cannot create a CNAME record for the top node of the DNS namespace, e.g., "example.com," but possible for "www.example.com."
- CNAME acts as an alias for "www.example.com" to "example.com."
- NS records define name servers for the hosted zone.
- CNAME stands for canonical name, indicating an alias pointing to the canonical name.

## Route 53 - Hosted Zones
- A container for records defining traffic routing for a domain and its subdomains.
- Public hosted zones route internet traffic, e.g., "app1.mypublicdomain.com."
- Private hosted zones route traffic within one or more VPCs, e.g., "app1.company.internal."
- Costs $0.50 per month per hosted zone.

## Route 53 TTL
- Caches results for the TTL of the record to reduce DNS queries frequency.

## CNAME vs. Alias
- CNAME points a hostname to another hostname but not for the root domain.
- Alias points to an AWS resource, applicable for both root and non-root domains, and is free.

## Route 53 Alias Records Targets
- Elastic Load Balancer
- CloudFront Distributions
- API Gateway
- Elastic Beanstalk
- S3 websites
- VPC interface
- Cannot set an alias record for an EC2 DNS name.

## Route 53 - Routing Policy
- Responds to DNS queries but doesn't route traffic.
- Simple routing directs traffic to a single resource or randomly chooses among multiple values in the same record.
- Weighted routing controls the percentage of requests to each resource, useful for load balancing.
- Latency-based routing redirects to the resource with the least latency.
- Failover routing requires association with a health check.
- Geolocation routing routes based on user location.
- Geoproximity routing routes based on user and resource geo location, with bias.
- IP-based routing routes based on client's IP address.
- Multi-value routing policy balances traffic among multiple resources, supporting up to 8 healthy records.

## Route 53 - Health Checks
- HTTP health checks are for public resources.
- Automatic DNS failover is possible.
- Health checks generate CloudWatch metrics.
- Health checks originate from worldwide locations.
- Supports HTTP, HTTPS, or TCP protocols.
- Only 2xx and 3xx status codes are considered passed.
- Calculated health checks combine results from multiple checks.
- Private hosted zones can't access VPC or on-premises resources but can create CloudWatch metrics and alarms.
