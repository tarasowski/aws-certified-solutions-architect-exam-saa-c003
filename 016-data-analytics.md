# Kinesis Data Streams
**Kinesis Data Streams:**

- **1 MB Message Size Limit:** Kinesis Data Streams imposes a limit of 1 MB on the size of individual messages that can be ingested into the stream.

- **Data Streams with Shards:** Data in Kinesis Data Streams is partitioned into shards, which are the basic units of scalability for the stream. Each shard provides a fixed unit of capacity for data ingestion and processing.

- **Shard Splitting & Merging:** To manage the scalability of a stream, shards can be dynamically split or merged. Shard splitting increases the capacity of a stream by dividing a shard into two smaller shards, while shard merging consolidates two adjacent shards into a single shard.

- **TLS In-flight Encryption:** Kinesis Data Streams supports Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption for in-flight data, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of data as it is transmitted between producers, Kinesis Data Streams, and consumers.

- **KMS At-rest Encryption:** Data stored in Kinesis Data Streams can be encrypted at rest using AWS Key Management Service (KMS). This encryption ensures that data is protected when stored persistently within the service.

**Amazon MSK (Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka):**

- **1 MB Default, Configurable for Higher (e.g., 10 MB):** Amazon MSK allows configuring the maximum message size, with a default limit of 1 MB. This limit can be adjusted as needed, for example, increasing it to 10 MB to accommodate larger messages.

- **Kafka Topics with Partitions:** In Amazon MSK, data is organized into Kafka topics, each of which can be divided into partitions. Partitions enable parallel processing of data and provide fault tolerance and scalability within a topic.

- **Can Only Add Partitions to a Topic:** Unlike Kinesis Data Streams, where shards are dynamically managed, in Amazon MSK, partitions are configured when creating a topic and cannot be dynamically added or removed after creation.

- **PLAINTEXT or TLS In-flight Encryption:** Amazon MSK supports both plaintext and TLS encryption for in-flight data, allowing users to choose the appropriate level of security for their Kafka clusters and data streams.

- **KMS At-rest Encryption:** Similar to Kinesis Data Streams, Amazon MSK offers KMS-based encryption for data at rest, providing an additional layer of security for stored data within the Kafka cluster.

In summary, both Kinesis Data Streams and Amazon MSK offer scalable and reliable solutions for streaming data ingestion and processing, with features such as encryption, partitioning, and scalability. The choice between them depends on factors such as specific use case requirements, existing infrastructure, and familiarity with Apache Kafka.

# Big data ingestion pipeline

5. **Lambda (Optional):** AWS Lambda can be used to manipulate the data as it passes through the Firehose delivery stream. This could involve data transformation, validation, or enrichment.

6. **Amazon S3:** Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) is used as the storage destination for the ingested data. It provides scalable object storage, and the data is stored durably and redundantly across multiple devices and facilities.

7. **SQS:** Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) is a fully managed message queuing service that enables you to decouple and scale microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications. It can be used to decouple the Lambda functions responsible for processing data.

8. **Lambda (Data Processing):** Another Lambda function can be triggered by messages from SQS. This Lambda function processes the data further, possibly performing additional transformations or aggregations.

9. **Athena:** Amazon Athena is a serverless query service that allows you to analyze data in Amazon S3 using standard SQL. It can be used to query the data stored in S3 for reporting and analytics purposes.

10. **Quicksight or Amazon Redshift:** The analyzed data can be visualized using Amazon QuickSight, a fully managed business intelligence service, or loaded into Amazon Redshift, a fully managed data warehouse service, for more in-depth big data analysis.

This pipeline allows you to ingest, process, store, analyze, and visualize large volumes of data from IoT devices, providing valuable insights for decision-making and business intelligence.
