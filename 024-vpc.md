# Networking VPC

# CIDR / Private vs. Public IP
# CIDR Method for IP Address Allocation

The Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) method revolutionized IP address allocation by introducing a flexible system based on address blocks and subnet masks.

- **CIDR Notation**: IP addresses are represented in CIDR notation, indicating the number of bits used for the network portion of the address. For example, /32 represents a single IP address, while /0 encompasses all possible IP addresses.

- **Base IP Ranges**: Common base IP ranges include 10.0.0.0 and 192.168.0.0, which are designated for private network use.

- **Subnet Masks**: Subnet masks are used to define the network portion of an IP address. Common subnet mask notations include /8, /16, /24, and /32.

  - /8 (255.0.0.0): Allows the last three octets to change.
  - /16 (255.255.0.0): Allows the last two octets to change.
  - /24 (255.255.255.0): Allows the last octet to change.
  - /32 (255.255.255.255): Represents a single IP address; no octet can change.

- **Octet Flexibility**: The CIDR notation determines the flexibility of each octet in an IP address.

  - /32: No octet can change.
  - /24: The last octet can change.
  - /16: The last two octets can change.
  - /8: The last three octets can change.
  - /0: All octets can change.

- **Example IP Ranges**:
  - **192.168.0.0/24**: Allows the last octet to change, resulting in 256 possible IPs (from 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.0.255).
  - **192.168.0.0/16**: Allows the last two octets to change, offering 65,536 possible IPs (from 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255).
  - **134.56.78.123/32**: Represents a single IP address, 134.56.78.123.

- **Private vs. Public IP Addresses**:

  The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) reserves certain blocks of IPv4 addresses for private (LAN) and public (Internet) use.

  - **Private IP Addresses**: Reserved for internal networks and cannot be directly accessed from the Internet.
    - 10.0.0.0/8: Commonly used in large networks.
    - 172.16.0.0/12: Default range for AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).
    - 192.168.0.0/16: Frequently used in home networks.

  - **Public IP Addresses**: All other IP addresses are designated for public use, accessible from the Internet.

Understanding CIDR notation and the distinction between private and public IP addresses is crucial for network management and security.

# Default VPC: AWS's Foundation for New Accounts

In Amazon Web Services (AWS), each new account is automatically provisioned with a default Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), simplifying setup for beginners.

- **Automatic Assignment**: All new accounts are initialized with a default VPC, streamlining the setup process for users.

- **Instance Launch**: Instances launched without specifying a subnet are automatically placed within the default VPC.

- **Connectivity and Addressing**:
  - The default VPC comes preconfigured with internet connectivity.
  - EC2 instances within the default VPC are assigned public IPv4 addresses for external communication.
  - Both public and private IPv4 DNS names are provided for convenience.

- **CIDR Block**: The CIDR block for the default VPC is 172.31.0.0/16, offering a range of 65,536 IP addresses.

- **Subnet Structure**:
  - The default VPC contains three subnets, each linked to the VPC and situated in different Availability Zones (AZs).
  - Each subnet has its own CIDR block.

- **Subnet Specifics**:
  - Example: 172.31.32.0/20
    - Despite the theoretical calculation of 4096 available IPs (2^12), practical limitations result in only 4091 usable IPs per subnet.
    - EC2 instances within these subnets are assigned public IPv4 addresses by default, though this setting can be adjusted.

- **Route Tables**:
  - A default route table is provided within the account for routing traffic within the VPC.
  - It typically contains two rules:
    - 172.31.0.0/16 -> Target Local
    - 0.0.0.0/0 -> Target igw-025fffe498cf4f00 (Internet Gateway)
  - All traffic destined for the internet is directed through the Internet Gateway (IGW) attached to the VPC.

Understanding the default VPC's structure and configuration is fundamental for managing resources effectively within the AWS ecosystem.
 
# VPC Overview: Building Blocks of AWS Networking

Amazon Web Services (AWS) Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) serve as the backbone for networking in the cloud, offering flexibility and control over your virtual network environment.

- **Regional Limitations**:
  - Each AWS region can accommodate a maximum of 5 VPCs.

- **CIDR Range**:
  - Each VPC can have up to 5 CIDR blocks, ranging from a minimum of /28 (16 IP addresses) to a maximum of /16 (65,536 IP addresses).
  - Example ranges include:
    - /12 (172.16.0.0/12)
    - /8 (10.0.0.0/8)
    - /16 (192.168.0.0/16)

- **CIDR Selection**:
  - Choose CIDR blocks carefully to avoid overlap with other networks, such as corporate environments.
  - VPC CIDRs must adhere to private IPv4 ranges to maintain internal network privacy.

- **Limitations**:
  - The maximum CIDR block size allowed for a VPC is /16; attempting to use a larger CIDR, such as /15, will result in failure.

- **Tenancy**:
  - By default, VPCs utilize shared tenancy, meaning instances share physical hardware.
  - Dedicated tenancy, which allocates dedicated hardware, is available but comes with additional costs.

- **IP CIDRs**:
  - Each VPC can have up to 5 IP CIDRs, providing flexibility in network design and segmentation.

Designing and configuring VPCs requires careful consideration of CIDR ranges, regional limits, and tenancy options to meet the specific needs of your AWS infrastructure while maintaining security and scalability.

# Adding Subnets: Segmenting Your VPC

In Amazon Web Services (AWS), subnets play a crucial role in segmenting your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) into smaller, manageable units, each with its own range of IPv4 addresses.

- **Definition**:
  - Subnets represent a subrange of IPv4 addresses within your VPC.

- **Reserved IP Addresses**:
  - AWS reserves 5 IP addresses within each subnet:
    - 10.0.0.0: Network address
    - 10.0.0.1: Reserved by AWS for VPC router
    - 10.0.0.2: Reserved for mapping to DNS
    - 10.0.0.3: Reserved for future use
    - 10.0.0.255: Network broadcast

- **CIDR Block Example**:
  - For example, if your CIDR block is 10.0.0.0/24, the reserved IP addresses are as listed above.

- **Exam Tip**:
  - When calculating the size of a subnet, remember to account for the 5 reserved IP addresses.
  - Example: If you need 29 IP addresses for EC2 instances:
    - Avoid choosing a subnet of size /27 (2^5 = 32) because 5 addresses are reserved, leaving only 27 IPs available.
    - Instead, select a subnet size of /26 (64 - 5 reserved), providing 59 usable IP addresses.

Understanding subnetting and the allocation of reserved IP addresses is essential for effectively managing resources within your VPC and ensuring efficient network communication.
 
# Internet Gateway (IGW): Gateway to the World Wide Web

In Amazon Web Services (AWS), an Internet Gateway (IGW) acts as a crucial component for enabling internet connectivity for resources within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), facilitating seamless communication with the broader internet.

- **Functionality**:
  - Allows EC2 instances and resources within a VPC to connect to the internet, enabling communication with external networks and services.

- **Scalability and Redundancy**:
  - Designed to scale horizontally and built with high availability and redundancy to ensure uninterrupted internet connectivity.

- **Creation and Attachment**:
  - Must be created separately from a VPC.
  - A single VPC can only be attached to one IGW, and vice versa.

- **Gateway Functionality**:
  - Alone, IGWs do not grant internet access; route tables within the VPC must be edited to direct traffic appropriately.

- **Route Table Configuration**:
  - Creation of a custom route table is necessary to enable connectivity for instances in public subnets.
  - Editing the route table ensures that traffic is directed to the IGW for internet-bound communication.

- **Public Subnet Settings**:
  - In the configuration of public subnets, the option to allow public IP addressing must be enabled to facilitate internet connectivity.

- **Setup Process**:
  - Creation of an IGW and subsequent attachment to the VPC initiates internet access for the VPC.
  - After IGW attachment, a new route table is created, assigned to the VPC, and subnet associations are configured.
  - In the public route table, the route 0.0.0.0/0 should be directed to the IGW as the target to enable internet access. Local routes, such as 10.0.6.0/16, should be directed locally.

Configuring IGWs and associated route tables is essential for establishing internet connectivity within a VPC, enabling seamless communication between instances and external networks.

# Bastion Hosts: Secure Gateway to Private Instances

Bastion hosts serve as a critical security measure for accessing EC2 instances located within private subnets from external networks, ensuring secure communication within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) setup.

- **Bastion Host Configuration**:
  - Placed within a public subnet, the bastion host acts as an entry point for accessing instances within private subnets securely.

- **Use Case**:
  - When an EC2 instance resides in a private subnet and requires SSH access, a bastion host facilitates the connection by acting as an intermediary.

- **Security Group Rules**:
  - The security group assigned to the bastion host must permit inbound SSH traffic (usually on port 22) from the internet but should restrict access to a specific CIDR range.
    - Example: Allow SSH traffic from the public CIDR of your corporate network.

- **Security Measures**:
  - To enhance security, the security group of EC2 instances located in private subnets should allow inbound traffic only from the security group of the bastion host or the private IP address of the bastion host.
    - This ensures that access is granted only through the bastion host, adding an additional layer of protection.

- **Networking Architecture**:
  - By establishing this architecture, the bastion host provides a secure gateway for accessing private instances while maintaining strict control over network access.

Integrating bastion hosts into your AWS architecture enhances security by enforcing controlled access to EC2 instances within private subnets, thereby safeguarding sensitive resources from unauthorized access.

  - Firewall Manager simplifies the management of AWS WAF, AWS Shield Advanced, and VPC security groups across multiple accounts and resources.

- **AWS Network Firewall**:
  - The AWS Network Firewall offers comprehensive protection for the entire VPC, providing layer 3 to layer 7 inspection and control over traffic.
  - It allows fine-grained control over traffic flows, including VPC-to-VPC, outbound to the internet, and inbound from the internet.
  - Rules can be defined based on IP, port, protocol, and even domain, with options to allow, drop, or alert for traffic matching specific criteria.
  - Flow inspection can be activated to detect and prevent network threats using intrusion prevention capabilities.

By implementing a layered approach to network protection leveraging these AWS services, organizations can effectively mitigate risks, defend against cyber threats, and ensure the security and integrity of their cloud environments.
