# IAM

**# AWS Organizations: Centralized Account Management**

AWS Organizations offers centralized management for AWS accounts, providing various benefits and controls for organizations. Here's an overview:

- **Account Structure:**
  - The main organization account serves as the management account, while others are member accounts.
  - Billing is consolidated across all accounts.
  
- **Cost Optimization:**
  - Aggregated usage enables pricing benefits like volume discounts for services such as EC2 and S3.

- **Automation and Organization:**
  - API allows for automated creation of accounts.
  - Accounts can be organized by business units, environments, or projects.

- **Security Enhancements:**
  - Each account has its own Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) for better isolation.
  - All actions are logged in CloudTrail for auditing purposes.

- **Service Control Policies (SCPs):**
  - SCPs function similarly to IAM policies but at the organizational level.
  - SCPs are attached at the root level, allowing you to define what actions are allowed or denied across member accounts.
  - Blocklist and allowlist can be implemented to control access to specific services.

- **Policy Enforcement:**
  - SCPs enable fine-grained control over services accessed within member accounts, ensuring better security posture.
  
- **Backup and Tag Policies:**
  - Backup and tag policies can be applied at the member account level for consistent management.

- **Organizational Units (OUs):**
  - Accounts are organized into OUs, allowing for the application of SCPs at different levels.
  - SCP inheritance ensures that restrictions apply hierarchically, even if an account is managed by a different team.

AWS Organizations offers a comprehensive suite of features for managing multiple AWS accounts, enabling organizations to enforce security policies, optimize costs, and streamline management tasks effectively.

**# IAM Conditions: Fine-Grained Access Control**

IAM Conditions allow for fine-grained access control within AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies. Here's a breakdown of commonly used conditions:

- **aws:SourceIp:** Restricts API calls based on the client's IP address.
- **aws:RequestRegion:** Limits access to specific AWS regions.
- **ec2:ResourceTag:** Restricts access based on resource tags, such as those applied to EC2 instances.
- **aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent:** Requires multi-factor authentication (MFA) for access.
- **S3 Bucket Policies:** Conditions can be applied within S3 bucket policies (bucketname) and object policies (/*) to control access at both the bucket and object levels.

IAM Conditions provide granular control over access permissions, allowing organizations to enforce security policies based on various factors such as IP address, region, resource tags, and MFA status. This enhances security by ensuring that access is granted only under specified conditions.


**# IAM Resource-based vs. IAM Role-based Access**

IAM offers both resource-based and role-based access control mechanisms, each with its own use cases and considerations:

- **Cross-Account Access:**
  - **Resource-based Policy:** Attaching a policy directly to a resource (e.g., S3 bucket policy).
  - **IAM Role:** Using a role as a proxy to access resources in another account.

- **Role Assumption:**
  - When a user, application, or service assumes a role, they adopt the permissions assigned to that role, relinquishing their original permissions.
  - With resource-based policies, the principal retains their original permissions.

- **Example Scenario:**
  - A user in Account A needs to scan a DynamoDB table in Account A and dump it into an S3 bucket in Account B.
  - Supported services for cross-account access include S3, SNS, and SQS.

**EventBridge:**
- When an EventBridge rule runs, it requires permissions on the target.
- **Resource-based Policy:** Lambda, SNS, SQS, S3 buckets, API Gateway.
- **IAM Role:** Kinesis stream, Systems Manager Run Command, ECS tasks.

**IAM Permissions Boundaries:**
- Supported for users and roles (not groups).
- Advanced feature utilizing a managed policy to set the maximum permissions an IAM entity can have.
- When a permissions boundary is set, additional permissions cannot be attached, ensuring a more restricted access scope.
- Can be used in conjunction with AWS Organizations SCPs.
- Use cases include allowing developers to manage their permissions while preventing privilege escalation.

IAM resource-based and role-based access controls offer flexibility and security in managing access to AWS resources, catering to various use cases and security requirements.

# IAM Policy Evaluation Logic

- **Deny Evaluation**: Deny permissions take precedence over allow permissions in IAM policy evaluation.
  
- **Organization SCP**: Service Control Policies (SCPs) at the organization level can further restrict permissions across member accounts.
  
- **Resource-based Policies**: These policies are attached directly to the AWS resource and define who can access the resource and what actions they can perform.

- **Identity-based Policies**: IAM policies attached to IAM identities (users, groups, roles) which define their permissions.

- **IAM Permissions Boundaries**: A feature that sets the maximum permissions an IAM entity can have. Policies cannot grant more permissions than the boundaries set.

- **Final Decision: Allow**: If there is no explicit deny or explicit allow, access to the resource or action is denied by default.

- **Session Policies**: Policies that are applied temporarily during a session. They are used to grant temporary permissions for a specific operation.

**Highlights**:
- Understanding the precedence of deny over allow is crucial for effective permission management.
- Organization SCPs provide centralized control over permissions across multiple accounts.
- Resource-based policies offer granular control over access to specific AWS resources.
- Identity-based policies define permissions for IAM entities like users, groups, and roles.
- IAM permissions boundaries prevent policies from granting excessive permissions.
- In the absence of explicit allow or deny, access is denied by default.
- Session policies can be used to grant temporary permissions for specific operations.

# IAM Identity Center (Single Sign-On)

- **One Login for All AWS Accounts**: Centralized authentication system allowing users to access multiple AWS accounts with a single set of credentials.
  
- **Integration with Business Apps**: Seamless integration with third-party business applications such as Salesforce, Box, and Microsoft.

- **App Assignments**:
  - SSO access to SAML 2.0-enabled business apps like Salesforce, Box, and Microsoft.
  - Provision required URLs, certificates, and metadata for seamless integration.

- **Attribution-based Access Control (ABAC)**:
  - Fine-grained permissions based on user attributes stored in IAM.
  - Attributes like cost center enable precise control over access.
  - Use Cases: Define permissions once, then modify AWS access by changing user attributes.

**Highlights**:
- IAM Identity Center simplifies access management by providing single sign-on across AWS accounts.
- Seamless integration with popular business applications enhances user experience.
- SAML 2.0 support ensures secure authentication and authorization processes.
- Fine-grained permissions enable precise control over access to resources and applications.
